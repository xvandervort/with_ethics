  Finishing up first pass at reporter (console output only).
  Now: Insert reporter into checking and then actually run a check from the command line!

    Wiring up to do simple file checks. (mostly done but not from command line yet)
    Adding a reporter so I can do some logging. At first, just to the console
    NEXT: Finish wiring things up so you can check for promised files and get back output.

    System needs a controller and a subcontroller that knows what has been promised and can configure tests to be run. That should be fun.
    I now have a "controller" that takes in the results of a yaml file, does some incredibly simple-minded sanity checking, and nothign else.
    NEXT: It should run some tests! (created controller, accepts promises object. Now RUN THEM ALL)

    Check for keeping of promises and following basic practices.
