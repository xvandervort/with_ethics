    System needs a controller and a subcontroller that knows what has been promised and can configure tests to be run. That should be fun.
    I now have a "controller" that takes in the results of a yaml file, does some incredibly simple-minded sanity checking, and nothign else.
    NEXT: It should run some tests! (created controller, accepts promises object. Now RUN THEM ALL)
